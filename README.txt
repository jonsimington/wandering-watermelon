I have not made any changes to how this code is compiled/ran. The standard make and ./testrun commands should work.
"--aiSettings DEPTH=*" sets desired max depth. Do not set this below 1. [This doesn't do anything anymore]
"--aiSettings TURNS=*" sets expected number of turns for use in time-limiting. Defaults to 200.

I have tested this code as much as I am able. If you encounter a problem, please try to provide me with enough information to replicate it.
